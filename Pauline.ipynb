    "# Name and movies datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we decided to work on the CMU movie dataset containing metadata extracted from Freebase, including Movie metadata like Movie box office revenue, genre, release date, runtime, and language but also Character metada like character names and aligned information about the actors who portray them, including gender and estimated age at the time of the movie's release. \n",
    "First let's see what the 2 metadasets contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characters\n",
    "The dataset contains informations  450,669 characters aligned to the movies such as Wikipedia movie ID,  Freebase movie ID, Movie release date, Character name, Actor date of birth, Actor gender, Actor height (in meters), Actor ethnicity,Actor name, Actor age at movie release, Freebase character/actor map ID, Freebase character ID, Freebase actor ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Movies\n",
    "The dataset contains informations on 81,741 movies such as the Wikipedia movie ID, Freebase movie ID, Movie name, Movie release date, Movie box office revenue, Movie runtime, Movie languages, Movie countries, Movie genres .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning task was implement in the *clean_raw_data()* method of our different CharacterData and MovieData classes implementation (by Wikipedia Movie ID) and validated using the *check_clean_data()* method, available and shared by the 2 datasets (python inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "From both metadataset, we directly oberved similar features such as Wikipedia Movie ID and Freebase Movie ID that is useful for futur merge of the 2 dataset. However, as in both datasets we saw that there were several columns containing Freebase and Wikipedia IDs for actors, characters and films, we decided to put them aside as the data is too difficult to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "This are the different steps we applied to both datasets before merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Character dataset:\n",
    "- Load with the right spacer.\n",
    "- Rename the columns for proper understanding.\n",
    "- Check the good type format : Actor date of birth and the Release Date as a datetime, and the other into objects.\n",
    "- Deal with missing values : we wrote them as NaN or NaT\n",
    "- Droping unwanted columns\n",
    "- Checking that the cleaning was made\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie dataset :\n",
    "- Load with the right spacer.\n",
    "- Rename the columns for proper understanding.\n",
    "- Modify the Language, Country and Genre columns:  the information was a JSON format not readable nor accessible so we isolate the information and replace it by a human-readable string format.\n",
    "- Modify the datatypes of movie runtime into timedelta and the release date into a datetime object for further manipulation.\n",
    "- Modify the movie Name, Language, Country and Genre:  we checked that they were in object type and modified them if not.\n",
    "- Deal with missing values : we wrote them as NaN or NaT\n",
    "- Dropping the unwanted columns\n",
    "- Check that the cleaning was made\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We kept the whole dataset with NaN and NaT values in a specific file to keep features that could be interesting even if the rate of missing values is very high (such as etchnicity or Box office revenue). However, for the following notebook, to make some we decided to remove this 2 columns since they have more than 70% missing values.\n",

    "- United Kingdom\n",
    "- AJOUTER AUTRE SI BESOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they all came from different places and didn't follow the same structure, we had to decide what kind of data was necessary for our project and what structure would be the most practical to work with. We ended-up with the following collumns in our dataframes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Year** : An integer value giving the year of the count \n",
    "2. **Name** :  A string representing the name that was counted\n",

    "All of our dataset had the same year format, but some had missing values in this field, which made those row useless and they were therefore discarded.\n",

    "This allows us to limit ourselves to names composed only of capitalized letters, spaces, '-' for composed names and ''' for the some regional variations. This rule is really strict and would have made us lose a considerable proportion of our dataset. This is where the data cleaning process came to help homogenize our data and it mainly consisted of the following operations:\n",

    "- Converting all the name to uppercase\n",
    "- Removing all accents on letter, for example é becomes e.\n",

    "Some names have different spellings, for example you can write JEREMY and JEREMIE, but we decided to count this as two separate entries since grouping \"similar\" is out of the scope of this project and is not an uniformised concept.\n",
