                                […] The droids are quickly captured by Jawa traders, who sell the pair to moisture farmers 
                                <span class="rouge">Owen</span> and <span class="rouge">Beru Lars</span> and their nephew, 
                                <span class="vert">Luke Skywalker</span>. While 
                                <span class="vert">Luke</span> is cleaning R2-D2, he accidentally triggers 
                                part of <span class="rouge">Leia</span>'s message, in which she requests help from 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> <span class="bleu-petasse">Kenobi</span>. The only "Kenobi"

                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Ben Kenobi</span> who lives in the nearby hills. The next 
                                morning, upon finding R2-D2 after he escapes to seek <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span>, <span class="vert">Luke</span> meets 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Ben Kenobi</span>, revealing himself to be 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span>. <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> tells 
                                <span class="vert">Luke</span> of his days as a Jedi Knight, one of a faction of former galactic 
                                peacekeepers who were wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncle's statements, 
                                <span class="vert">Luke</span> learns that his father <span class="rouge">Anakin Skywalker</span> 
                                fought alongside <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> as a Jedi Knight before he was betrayed and

                                who turned to the "dark side of the Force" and gives <span class="vert">Luke</span> his father's 
                                lightsaber. <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> views <span class="rouge">Leia</span>'s complete 
                                message in which she begs <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> to take the Death Star plans to her 
                                home planet of Alderaan for her father to retrieve and analyze. He then asks <span class="vert">Luke</span> to accompany him and learn the ways of the Force. 
                                <span class="vert">Luke</span> initially refuses but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial 
                                stormtroopers have destroyed his home and killed his aunt and uncle in search of 
                                C-3PO and R2-D2. <span class="bleu-petasse">Obi-Wan</span> and <span class="vert">Luke</span> hire smuggler

                                […] Discovered with <span class="vert">Jack Dawson</span> on the stern, 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose Dawson Calvert</span> tells 
                                <span class="rouge">Cal</span> that she was looking over the ship's edge in curiosity and that 
                                <span class="vert">Jack</span> saved her from falling. Pressed, <span class="vert">Jack</span> confirms her account. 
                                <span class="rouge">Cal</span> is at first aloof to <span class="vert">Jack</span>, but when 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span> indicates that recognition is due, he offers him a small amount of money. 
                                After <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span> mocks <span class="rouge">Cal</span> for this, asking if her life means so little, 
                                he invites <span class="vert">Jack</span> to a first-class dinner the following night. 
                                <span class="vert">Jack</span> and <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span> develop a tentative friendship, 
                                even though <span class="rouge">Cal</span> and <span class="jaune">Ruth DeWitt Bukater</span> 
                                are wary of the young third-class man. Following the dinner that night, 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span> secretly joins <span class="vert">Jack</span> at a party in the ship's third-class quarter. 
                                Because <span class="rouge">Cal</span> and <span class="jaune">Ruth</span> forbid her to see <span class="vert">Jack</span>, 
                                <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span> attempts to rebuff <span class="vert">Jack</span>'s continuing advances. She soon realizes, 
                                though, that she prefers him over <span class="rouge">Cal</span>, and meets him at the bow of the ship during what turns out to be 
                                the Titanic's final moments of daylight. They then go to <span class="bleu-petasse">Rose</span>'s stateroom, where she asks 
                                <span class="vert">Jack</span> to sketch her nude while wearing the Heart of the Ocean, 
                                <span class="rouge">Cal</span>'s engagement present to her. […]
