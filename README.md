## Abstract
*This is a ~150 word description of the project idea and goals. What's our motivation ? What story do we want to tell*

Movies, and more generally TV content are known to be a powerfull source of influence. Jennifer Aniston's haircut, introduced in the TV show *Friends*, is considered to have become one of the most requested ever in history. 

Our goal is to evaluate wether movies have influenced even the deepest part of who we are: our names.

In order to investigate this topic, we'll use 






## Quickstart

```bash
# clone project
git clone <project link>
cd <project repo>

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.11 or ...
conda activate <env_name>


# install requirements
pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
```



### How to use the library
Tell us how the code is arranged, any explanations goes here.
